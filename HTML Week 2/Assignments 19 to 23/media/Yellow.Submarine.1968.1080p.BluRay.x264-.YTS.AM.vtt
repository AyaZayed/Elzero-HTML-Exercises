No. I only work with my mates.

I used to go out with his sister.

You mustn't do that.

there'll be rough seas ahead.

What do you think of that?

00:23:05,198 --> 00:23:07,700
Right, then,
let's get this vessel shipshape.

submarine shape.

269

Soft, isn't it?

270
00:23:59,961 --> 00:24:01,545
Not if you're on the bottom.

271
00:24:01,671 --> 00:24:04,882
All right, lads,
time to stow the gab and turn to.

272
00:24:05,634 --> 00:24:07,551
Groovy. How do you start this thing?

273
00:24:08,595 --> 00:24:11,389
It starts with a Blue Meanie attack.

274
00:24:11,515 --> 00:24:14,100
Supposing there's no Blue Meanies
in the neighbourhood?

PAUL: Do you ever get the feeling...
JOHN: Yeah.

318
00:26:55,762 --> 00:26:59,473
that things aren't as rosy
as they appear to be under the surface?

319

GEORGE: What's happening, John?

320
00:27:01,476 --> 00:27:03,477
JOHN: In my humble opinion,
we've become involved

321
00:27:03,603 --> 00:27:07,356
in Einstein's time-space
continuum theory.

322
00:27:07,482 --> 00:27:09,650
- Relatively speaking, that is.
- Of course.

323
00:27:10,777 --> 00:27:12,920
GEORGE: Maybe time's gone on strike.
PAUL: What for?

324
00:27:12,946 --> 00:27:15,030
- Shorter hours.
- I don't blame it.

325
00:27:15,156 --> 00:27:17,032
It must be very tiring being time,
mustn't it?

326
00:27:17,158 --> 00:27:19,910
- ALL: Why?
- It's a twenty-four hour day, isn't it?

327
00:27:20,036 --> 00:27:22,037
- You surprise me, Ringo.
- Why?

328
00:27:22,163 --> 00:27:26,667
- Dealing in abstracts.
- Just because I'm a drummer...

329
00:27:26,793 --> 00:27:31,005
- I don't half feel funny.
- You're not half the lad you used to be.

330
00:27:31,131 --> 00:27:32,840
Look, everything's getting bigger.

331
00:27:32,966 --> 00:27:35,301
It's not.
It's us that are getting smaller...

332
00:27:36,303 --> 00:27:38,470
- I want my mam.
- ... and younger.

333
00:27:38,597 --> 00:27:41,557
There you are, lads.
Old Fred will get you out of all this.

334
00:27:43,643 --> 00:27:45,352
Look at that!

335
00:27:45,478 --> 00:27:49,315
- It's all a load of Father Xmas's.
- JOHN: It's not. It's Father Time.

336
00:27:49,441 --> 00:27:51,125
- How do you know?
- I read it in a book.

337
00:27:51,151 --> 00:27:54,737
I don't want to alarm you,
but the years are going backwards.

338
00:27:54,863 --> 00:27:57,031
What's that mean, Old Fred?

339
00:27:57,157 --> 00:27:59,366
If we slip back through time
at this rate,

340
00:27:59,492 --> 00:28:01,994
very soon we'll all disappear
up our own existence.

341
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:06,248
- What are we gonna do, then?
- We could always try a few buttons.

342
00:28:06,791 --> 00:28:09,376
- (Tolling bell)
- I want my mam.

343
00:28:09,502 --> 00:28:11,962
FRED: Time's fast running out for us,
I'm afraid.

344
00:28:12,088 --> 00:28:14,981
- Can't we do something to the clock?
- RINGO: What do you mean, John?

345
00:28:15,007 --> 00:28:16,942
JOHN: Move the hands forward,
see what happens.

346
00:28:16,968 --> 00:28:18,285
FRED: Clever lad.

347
00:28:18,311 --> 00:28:20,062
GEORGE: Something strange is happening.

348
00:28:28,063 --> 00:28:29,480
It's speeding up now.

353

RINGO: There's someone in it. Look.

354
00:28:49,209 --> 00:28:52,127
GEORGE: And they're waving.
RINGO: It's a group of fellas.

355
00:28:52,796 --> 00:28:54,755
Wave back.

356
00:28:54,881 --> 00:28:57,758
GEORGE: Maybe we're both part of
a vast yellow submarine fleet.

357
00:28:57,884 --> 00:28:59,593
There's only two of us.

358
00:28:59,719 --> 00:29:03,347
Then I would suggest that
yonder yellow submarine is ourselves

she's puttered out.

497
00:41:22,711 --> 00:41:26,005

- Can't. No road.

500
00:41:31,137 --> 00:41:34,681
I know something about motors.
Let me have a look.

501
00:41:34,807 --> 00:41:37,100
- Here.
- Is that the motor?

502
00:41:37,226 --> 00:41:39,561
Can't you tell one
when you see one?

503
00:41:39,687 --> 00:41:41,563
Of course I can.
Let me peruse it.

504
00:41:41,689 --> 00:41:44,190
(Electrical buzzing)

505
00:41:44,942 --> 00:41:47,068
- What do you think?
- I think I burned my finger.

506
00:41:47,194 --> 00:41:49,737
Here, lads. Look at this.

507
00:41:49,864 --> 00:41:51,948
- What do you think it is?
- Nothing.

508
00:41:52,074 --> 00:41:53,533
Looks like nothing.

509
00:41:53,659 --> 00:41:55,577
It's a local inhabitant.

510
00:41:55,703 --> 00:41:57,537
RINGO: He's probably one of the nothings.

511
00:41:57,663 --> 00:41:59,706
PAUL: At least that's something.

512
00:41:59,832 --> 00:42:01,708
- PAUL: Let's show him our motor.
- Steady on.

513
00:42:01,834 --> 00:42:04,210
You don't want to show
your motor to just anybody.

514
00:42:04,336 --> 00:42:05,587
But this is a nobody.

515
00:42:05,713 --> 00:42:10,758
Medic, pedic, zed oblique,
orphic, morphic, dorphic, Greek.

516
00:42:10,885 --> 00:42:13,720
Ad hoc, ad loc and quid pro quo.

517
00:42:13,846 --> 00:42:16,723
So little time, so much to know.

518
00:42:16,849 --> 00:42:18,349
Can you tell us where we're at?

519
00:42:18,476 --> 00:42:20,602
A true Socratic query, that.

520
00:42:20,728 --> 00:42:22,770
And who the Billy Shears are you?

521
00:42:22,897 --> 00:42:26,357
Who? Who indeed am I?

522
00:42:27,860 --> 00:42:29,277
Jeremy?

523
00:42:30,362 --> 00:42:31,696

526
00:42:36,535 --> 00:42:38,953
Eminent physicist, polyglot, classicist,

527
00:42:39,079 --> 00:42:41,289
prize-winning botanist,
hard biting satirist,

528
00:42:41,415 --> 00:42:44,751
- talented pianist, good dentist, too.
- PAUL: Lousy poet.

529
00:42:44,877 --> 00:42:46,669
Critic's voice,
take your choice.

530
00:42:46,795 --> 00:42:49,714
- Must be one of them angry young men.
- Or a daffy old creep.

531
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:51,841
I, daffy old creep?

532
00:42:53,052 --> 00:42:57,013
- Do you speak English?
- Old English, middle, a dialect, pure...

533
00:42:57,139 --> 00:43:00,350
- Well, do you speak English?
- You know, I'm not sure.

534
00:43:00,476 --> 00:43:03,269
He's so smart, he doesn't even
remember what he knows.

535
00:43:03,395 --> 00:43:05,188
Why don't we show him our motor?

536
00:43:05,314 --> 00:43:07,273
Should we really...
show him our motor?

537
00:43:07,399 --> 00:43:08,775
He may not have seen one before.

538
00:43:08,901 --> 00:43:11,236
Turbo-prop, super-combustible spring.

539
00:43:11,362 --> 00:43:13,530
Metrocyclonic and stereophonic,

540
00:43:13,656 --> 00:43:17,158
this motor, I see,
has a broken down thing.

541
00:43:18,619 --> 00:43:20,245
- He fixed it.
- He fixed it?

542
00:43:20,371 --> 00:43:21,746
Great. Let's go.

543
00:43:23,582 --> 00:43:28,169
I must complete my bust, two novels,
finish my blueprints, begin my beguine.

544
00:43:28,295 --> 00:43:30,797
Must you always talk in rhyme?

545
00:43:30,923 --> 00:43:35,260
If I spoke prose, you'd all find out,
I don't know what I talk about.

546
00:43:35,386 --> 00:43:37,887
Ad hoc, ad loc and quid pro quo.

547
00:43:38,013 --> 00:43:40,098
So little time, so much to know.

548
00:43:41,350 --> 00:43:42,350
Hey, fellas. Look.

549
00:43:42,476 --> 00:43:45,103
The footnotes for my 19th book.

550
00:43:45,229 --> 00:43:47,188
This is my standard procedure
for doing it.

551
00:43:47,314 --> 00:43:49,566
And while I compose it,
I'm also reviewing it.

552
00:43:49,692 --> 00:43:52,652
- A boob for all seasons.
- How can he lose?

553
00:43:52,778 --> 00:43:53,903
Were your notices good?

554
00:43:54,029 --> 00:43:55,989
It's my policy never to read my reviews.

555
00:43:56,115 --> 00:43:58,658
There must be a word for what he is.

What about him?

578
00:46:40,904 --> 00:46:43,406
He's happy enough
going around in circles.

579
00:46:44,658 --> 00:46:46,075
Poor little fella.

580
00:46:46,827 --> 00:46:49,662
I don't know.
Ringo's just a sentimentalist.

581
00:46:50,414 --> 00:46:52,749
Look at him.
Can't he come with us?

582
00:46:56,962 --> 00:47:00,339
Mr. Boob, you can come with us,
if you like.

583
00:47:00,466 --> 00:47:02,925
You mean, you'd take a Nowhere Man?

Come on, we'll take you somewhere.

585
00:47:06,597 --> 00:47:08,681
Okay, Booby. Down the hatch.

586
00:47:08,807 --> 00:47:12,518
Down the hatch.
A quite curious phrase.

587
00:47:12,644 --> 00:47:15,813
The middle South Midlands
Victorian phase.

588
00:47:15,939 --> 00:47:18,608
Its usage undoubtedly on the increase.

589
00:47:18,734 --> 00:47:21,360
I must work it into
my New Statesman piece.

590
00:47:21,487 --> 00:47:24,280
- That's the hatch, friend.
- Indeed.

591
00:47:24,406 --> 00:47:26,866

Prepare to go forward.

What shall we do, Jeremy?

596
00:47:50,974 --> 00:47:56,646
Repair, revive, revamp, renew.
Ipse dixit, just turn the screw.

- Chewing gum will do the job.

PAUL: We've lost the sub for good.

- RINGO: Or for worse.

606
00:48:39,731 --> 00:48:42,817

JOHN: It looks like the foothills.

Didn't Old Fred mention something
about the Sea of Holes

669
00:54:02,888 --> 00:54:05,055
- just before the Sea of Green?
- Yeah.

670
00:54:05,182 --> 00:54:07,183
Through one of them slots
must be the Sea of Green.

00:54:07,309 --> 00:54:09,393
But which? Which one?

Thesis, antithesis, synthesis,

673

causes of causal causation.

00:54:19,196 --> 00:54:24,241

00:54:24,367 --> 00:54:27,578
There are simply no holes
in my education.

676
00:54:28,747 --> 00:54:32,333
You mean you haven't composed
a whole book?

677
00:54:32,459 --> 00:54:34,835
Oh, great.
What shall we do?

678
00:54:34,961 --> 00:54:37,338
Be empirical. Look.

681
00:54:41,384 --> 00:54:43,719
Great. Come on, let's all
look for the Sea of Green.

682
00:54:43,845 --> 00:54:49,475
The Sea of Holes...
into the Sea of Green.

683
00:54:52,103 --> 00:54:56,232
Hydrolate, verdant chrysodine.

684
00:54:56,358 --> 00:54:58,776
I think we're near the Sea of Green.

685
00:55:06,993 --> 00:55:09,828
I've got a hole in my pocket.

686
00:55:10,455 --> 00:55:12,581
Where's Jeremy?

687
00:55:12,707 --> 00:55:13,874
He was over there.

688
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,502
- He's not here now.
- JOHN: He must have jumped ship, then.

689
00:55:16,628 --> 00:55:19,755
He wouldn't do that.
He's our friend.

690
00:55:19,881 --> 00:55:24,343
Booby, Jeremy, Hillary,
where are you?

GEORGE: And drab.

PAUL: And quiet.

695
00:55:54,332 --> 00:55:55,749
Safe at last.

696
00:55:56,543 --> 00:55:59,378
And none the worse for our adventures.

697
00:55:59,504 --> 00:56:03,632
Reminiscent in many ways
of the late Mr. Ulysses.

698
00:56:07,220 --> 00:56:09,138

FRED: There she blows!

701
00:56:33,121 --> 00:56:38,083
Lord Mayor, sir...
I've made it, I'm back.

702
00:56:38,209 --> 00:56:40,711
- Who's this?
- Our Lord Mayor.

703
00:56:41,629 --> 00:56:43,339
He's been bonked.

704
00:56:43,465 --> 00:56:47,051
Lord Mayor, sir...
unbonk yourself.

705
00:56:48,553 --> 00:56:51,764
Even a little snatch of a tune
might get him up again.

706
00:56:51,890 --> 00:56:53,265
All right, let's sing.

707
00:56:53,391 --> 00:56:58,979
♪ Have you got time to rectify,
time to rectify... ♪

708
00:56:59,105 --> 00:57:01,774
Do I hear music?

709
00:57:03,068 --> 00:57:06,987
Do I see... Young Fred?

710
00:57:07,113 --> 00:57:09,239
You do, Lord Mayor.

711
00:57:11,034 --> 00:57:14,620
Bless my metronome.

712
00:57:14,746 --> 00:57:16,955
And did you bring help?

713
00:57:17,082 --> 00:57:19,625
Yes, yes. Look.

714
00:57:19,751 --> 00:57:23,295
Holy pizzicato, Young Fred.

715
00:57:24,923 --> 00:57:28,384
It's quite uncanny, your faces...

716
00:57:28,510 --> 00:57:29,885
We're quite cute, really.

717
00:57:30,011 --> 00:57:32,888
You could pass for the originals.

718
00:57:33,014 --> 00:57:34,807
We are the originals.

719
00:57:34,933 --> 00:57:38,977

JOHN: They couldn't be much
with a name like that.

721
00:57:41,481 --> 00:57:42,481
Sergeant Pepper?

722
00:57:42,607 --> 00:57:47,277
LORD MAYOR: You could impersonate them
and rally the land to rebellion.

723
00:57:49,864 --> 00:57:52,491
Where are your instruments?

724
00:57:52,617 --> 00:57:55,577
RINGO: Lost in the Monstrous Sea.
JOHN: Sea of Monsters.

725
00:57:55,703 --> 00:57:58,247
FRED: We'll get other instruments,
Lord Mayor.

726
00:57:58,373 --> 00:58:00,165
Not a chance.

727
00:58:00,291 --> 00:58:04,670
The Meanies captured everything
that maketh music.

728
00:58:04,796 --> 00:58:06,755
They hate music that much, do they?

729
00:58:06,881 --> 00:58:10,259
They shrink at the very sound.

It's not very light in here, is it?

Shh! Keep the noise down.

760
01:02:59,048 --> 01:03:01,216

- It's their uniforms.

all things are possible.

888
01:15:53,271 --> 01:15:56,006
PAUL: It's not a goldfish bowl.
RINGO: Just a big glass bowl, then.

889
01:15:56,032 --> 01:15:58,867
- It's blue glass.
- It must be from Kentucky.

890
01:16:04,583 --> 01:16:05,917
RINGO: There's something inside.

891
01:16:06,043 --> 01:16:08,251

GEORGE: What are they doing there?

892

that's for sure.

If I could come in here...

899
01:16:19,473 --> 01:16:23,935
I think the theory put forward by Einstein
could well be applied here.

900
01:16:24,061 --> 01:16:27,271
The people in the ball are obviously
extensions of our own personalities,

901
01:16:27,397 --> 01:16:28,940
suspended, as it were, in time,

902
01:16:29,066 --> 01:16:32,652
frozen in space, according to
the now famous Theory of Relativity,

903
01:16:32,778 --> 01:16:36,072
which, briefly explained,
is simply a matter of taking two eggs...

904

GEORGE: John!
- ... beating lightly

905
01:16:37,658 --> 01:16:39,191

GEORGE: John!
- George?

907
01:16:40,953 --> 01:16:42,787
- How do we get them out?
- Break the glass.

908
01:16:44,081 --> 01:16:46,624
- We can't. It's Beatle-proof.
- Nothing is Beatle-proof.

909
01:16:46,750 --> 01:16:49,710
Have you got your drumsticks with you?
A drum break might shatter it.

910
01:16:49,836 --> 01:16:51,729
- No, I haven't.
- Have a look in your pocket.

911
01:16:51,755 --> 01:16:55,007
I've got a hole in my pocket.

912
01:16:55,133 --> 01:16:58,135
I wonder if...
Yeah, it still works.

RINGO: Yeah, without a doubt.

920
01:17:26,164 --> 01:17:29,417
- We're the spitting image of each other.
- Golly, yeah.

921
01:17:30,210 --> 01:17:33,421
I'm led to believe that you're
an extension of my personality.

922
01:17:33,547 --> 01:17:37,383
- Yes, I'm the alter-ego man.
- And I'm the ego man, goo goo, g'joob.

923
01:17:38,343 --> 01:17:39,760
I'm glad you asked me that.

924
01:17:39,886 --> 01:17:42,763
Because as a matter of fact
there's a war on.

925
01:17:42,889 --> 01:17:45,683
Then, brothers in war,
to the skirmish must we hence.

- Catchy tune, that.
- I can't seem to get it out of my head.

1040
01:27:56,544 --> 01:27:59,588
- Then shake it.
- That's what we've been doing all night.

1041
01:27:59,714 --> 01:28:01,256
Yeah, it was a great party.

lots of lovely souvenirs.

- A hole?

1045
01:28:10,099 --> 01:28:13,477
Half a hole, anyway.
I gave the rest to Jeremy.

1046

What can he do with half a hole?

1047
01:28:15,813 --> 01:28:18,649
Fix it to keep his mind from wandering.

1048

Hey.
Look at John, will you?

1049

- Singing.
